Brutus Parking System is a simple parking management program written in C++. The system allows users to park different types of vehicles (Bikes, Cars, and Others) by selecting their vehicle type and making a payment. The program tracks the availability of parking spaces for each vehicle type and ensures that users are assigned a spot when available.

Features

Vehicle Selection: Users can select from three types of vehicles: Bike, Car, and Other.

Space Availability: The system checks the availability of parking spaces and assigns a spot if space is available.

Payment: The system processes the payment for parking, with different rates for each vehicle type.

Repeatability: Users can choose to run the system again to park additional vehicles without restarting the program.

Space Tracking: The system tracks the current number of parked vehicles for each type (Bike, Car, Other) and ensures no vehicle type exceeds the maximum parking capacity.

How to Use

Upon running the program, the system will ask you to select your vehicle type: Bike, Car, or Other.

Based on your selection, it will check the availability of parking spaces. If space is available, the system will assign a spot and ask for the payment.

After the transaction, the program will show a confirmation message and ask if you want to run the program again.

If you want to park another vehicle, type 'y' to continue. If you're done, type 'n' to exit the program.
